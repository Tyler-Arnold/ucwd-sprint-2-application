                <h2> B.C Rich </h2>
            </header>

            <p> This brand of guitar specialises in the heavy metal and hard rock. B.C Rich are known for producing some of the most legendary designs in the history of metal. These instruments helped paved the way for the hard rock and thrash revolution
                of the 1980s. Even today B.C Rich is still a great brand of guitar which allow designs to sound and look as edgy as it can be.</p>

                <h2> Carvin / Kiesel </h2>
            </header>

            <p> Carvin / Kiesel is a guitar company with a completely different business model than the other companies. These types of guitars you won't find in store because they only produce custom made guitars. The designs are based off basic templates
                to which the buyer picks out the feature components themself, because of this it is unlikely you'll see two Carvin / Kiesel brand guitars looking the same.</p>

                <h2> Charvel </h2>
            </header>

            <p> Charvel guitars were seen as the front and centre for hard rock, metal and the outright crazy solos. Then came the 1990s which began to see less and less of the front and centre Charvel as everything was now in favor of droning guitars however
                it was only a matter of time until Charvel came back into power.</p>

                <h2> Dean </h2>
            </header>

            <p> Dean is one of the best guitar companies to look into if you are into metal. Dean's classic ML design has become a shining icon in the extreme rock genre. In the 1990s the old ML was brought back to life and Dean has since expanded upon the
                concept introducing some new sharper modern designs. Not only Dean makes great guitars for metal but also for blues, country and some acoustics.</p>
