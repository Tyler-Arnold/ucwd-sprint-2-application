                Pedals are option but recommended for electric guitars as they enhance the sound of your guitars through your amp<br /> There are two types of pedals: Digital and analog<br> Digital pedals are good for beginners as they are able to produce
                many effects in one pedal, the only downside is that they might not sound as good as analog<br /> Analog pedals produce one effect at a higher sound quality output and are better for those who know what kind of sound theyre looking for,
                it is also possible to chain analog pedals together to combine multiple effects to your guitar.

                A capo is a device usually used to hold all the strings down on a single fret, if would like to purchase a capo, make sure it fits into the specific guitar type you have, a capo for a classical guitar may work on an electric but it is recommended you
                buy one specifically for your guitar type.

                This device is handy especially if you havent developed your tuning ear yet, it helps tell you which string that you're currently strumming is out of tune, it can also help you reach a different kind of tuning if you would like to experiment.
