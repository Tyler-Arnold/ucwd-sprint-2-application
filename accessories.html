                <br /> There are many types of guitar strings that you can choose from, some strings are made for specific kinds of guitars e.g nylon strings are meant for classical guitars while steel strings are meant for electric<br> guitar strings
                also have different gauges or thicknesses, the gauge of a string changes the sound of the string, its down to preference on what gauge you want to play on

            <p>
                Pedals are option but recommended for electric guitars as they enhance the sound of your guitars through your amp<br /> There are two types of pedals: Digital and analog<br> Digital pedals are good for beginners as they are able to produce
                many effects in one pedal, the only downside is that they might not sound as good as analog<br /> Analog pedals produce one effect at a higher sound quality output and are better for those who know what kind of sound theyre looking for,
                it is also possible to chain analog pedals together to combine multiple effects to your guitar.
